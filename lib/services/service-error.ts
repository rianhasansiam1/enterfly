/**
 * Base class every domain service throws.
 *
 * Route handlers don't need to know which subclass got thrown — they pass
 * the error to `handleServiceError` which maps it to the right HTTP
 * response. Adds two benefits:
 *   - One try/catch shape across cart, order, wishlist, etc.
 *   - Anything that isn't a ServiceError is logged and returned as a
 *     generic 500, so we never leak stack traces or DB errors to clients.
