/**
 * Single client-side provider tree mounted by the root layout.
 *
 * Wraps the app in:
 *   - NextAuth's `SessionProvider` so any descendant client component can
 *     call `useSession`, `signIn`, or `signOut`.
 *   - The Redux store so dispatch/select hooks work app-wide.
 *   - `<StoreHydrator />` to populate cart/wishlist from localStorage
 *     (and the server for authenticated users) on first mount so that
 *     navbar badges render the correct counts immediately.
 *   - `<Toaster />` for lightweight toast notifications (small actions).
 *   - `<ConfirmDialog />` for SweetAlert-style confirmation modals (major actions).
 *
 * Kept as one file so the root layout only mounts one client boundary.
